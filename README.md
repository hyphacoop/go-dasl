# go-dasl

A Go reference library for [DASL](https://dasl.ing).

ðŸš§ Not ready for production yet ðŸš§

## Usage

```
go get github.com/hyphacoop/go-dasl@latest
```

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"

	"github.com/hyphacoop/go-dasl/cid"
	"github.com/hyphacoop/go-dasl/drisl"
)

type Data struct {
    Name      string    `cbor:"name"`
    Count     int       `cbor:"count"`
    Timestamp time.Time `cbor:"timestamp"`
    ID        cid.Cid   `cbor:"id"`
    Ref       cid.Cid   `cbor:"ref"`
}

func main() {
    // Create a CID for some data
    id, _ := drisl.CalculateCidForValue(map[string]string{"hello": "world"})
    ref, _ := cid.NewCidFromString("bafkreifn5yxi7nkftsn46b6x26grda57ict7md2xuvfbsgkiahe2e7vnq4")

    data := Data{
        Name:      "example",
        Count:     42,
        Timestamp: time.Date(2023, 6, 15, 14, 30, 45, 0, time.UTC),
        ID:        id,
        Ref:       ref,
    }

    bytes, err := drisl.Marshal(data)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    fmt.Printf("%x\n", bytes)
}
```

### Smaller Encodings with Struct Tag Options

Struct tags automatically reduce encoded size of structs and improve speed.

We can write less code by using struct tag options:
- `toarray`: encode without field names (decode back to original struct)
- `omitempty`: omit empty field when encoding
- `omitzero`: omit zero-value field when encoding

As a special case, struct field tag "-" omits the field.

NOTE: When a struct uses `toarray`, the encoder will ignore `omitempty` and `omitzero` to prevent position of encoded array elements from changing. This allows decoder to match encoded elements to their Go struct field.

## Submodules

DASL has many specs, only some of which are implemented here.

- DRISL (dag-cbor): implemented
- CID: implemented (including BDASL)
- RASL: stretch goal
- MASL: stretch goal
- CAR: currently out of scope

## Versioning

This library follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

- Pre-release versions (like x.y.z-alpha) are not intended to be used by the public
- Zero versions (0.y.z) are ready to use, but may have breaking changes
- 1.0.0 will be released once the DRISL and CID specs have been finalized

## Funding

Development and maintenance of this library is funded by [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech)
via the [Open Impact Foundation](https://openimpact.foundation/).
Work is performed by [Hypha](https://hypha.coop/).
